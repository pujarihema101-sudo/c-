🌟 C++ Overview

C++ is a high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983.
It is an extension of C, adding classes, objects, and OOP features.

C++ is widely used for:

System software (OS, drivers)

Game development

Competitive programming / DSA

Desktop & embedded applications

🔹 Key Features of C++
Feature	Description
Object-Oriented	Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
Performance	Faster execution like C (low-level memory control)
Standard Template Library (STL)	Pre-built data structures & algorithms
Cross-Platform	Works on Windows, Linux, macOS
Rich Library Support	Input/output, math, graphics, and more
🔹 Basic Syntax
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, C++!" << endl;
    return 0;
}


#include <iostream> → input/output library

cout → prints output

endl → newline

🔹 Common Data Types
Type	Size (approx)	Example
int	4 bytes	int age = 25;
float	4 bytes	float pi = 3.14;
double	8 bytes	double salary = 45000.50;
char	1 byte	char grade = 'A';
bool	1 byte	bool isPassed = true;
🔹 OOP Concepts in C++

Class & Object

Inheritance

Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)

Encapsulation

Abstraction

🔹 Example: Simple C++ Program With Input
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    int age;

    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;

    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;

    cout << "Hello " << name << ", you are " << age << " years old." << endl;

    return 0;
}

🔹 Why Use C++

Fast execution for performance-critical apps

Great for learning DSA and competitive programming

Large community & open-source support

Powers major applications like games and OS components
